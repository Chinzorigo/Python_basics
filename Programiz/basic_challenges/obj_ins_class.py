Object Inside Class
Hard
Problem Description
Write a program to create an object of one class inside another class.

Create Classes

Create two classes: Engine with attribute power, and Vehicle with attributes: wheels and engine.
Use the __init__() method with two arguments: self and power to create and initialize the power attribute of the Engine class.
Use the __init__() method with two arguments self and wheels to initialize the wheels attribute of the Vehicle class.
Inside the __init__() method of Vehicle, the engine attribute should be assigned with an object of the Engine class with the power attribute equal to 400.
Create another method named get_power() inside the Vehicle class and print the power attribute of the engine attribute.
Outside classes

Create an object of the Vehicle class with wheels attribute equal to 4.
Call the get_power() method of this object.
For hints, see the code outline.

Example
Expected Output

400

'''


# create the Engine class
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, power):
        self.power = power


# create the Vehicle class
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, wheels):
        self.wheels = wheels
        self.engine = Engine(400)

    def get_power(self):
        print(self.engine.power)


# create an object of the Vehicle class
v = Vehicle(4)

# call the get_power() method of this object

v.get_power()
# 400
# 400
